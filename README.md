# Introducing Java Programming Concepts through Making a Retro-style Game
## About 
This project was created in an effort to increase interest and participation in computing and technology among K-12 and undergraduate students. In our workshop, we walked students through the step-by-step process of developing a simple game in Processing to show that learning the fundamental programming concepts was not as hard as it might seem. 
## Description
* Difficulty Level: Medium 
* Target Audience: students of all ages 
* Duration of Workshop: 75-105 minutes 
* Needed Materials: Regular devices with keyboard. 
* Learning Outcomes: 
  1. Having a basic understanding of the fundamental programming concepts in Java such as loops, if else statements, and object-oriented programming that could also be applied to other languages. 
  2. Familiarizing students with the rudimentary keywords and functions in Processing and learning to manipulate elementary mathematical functions to create geometric shapes and visual designs. 
  3. Encouraging students to pursuit STEM majors.

* This TAP project is our take on the classic game Space Invaders. Using Processing, we are able to develop a multiplayer retro style arcade game with the inspiration from the Japanese 1978 fixed shooter video game. It's a fun and simple game created in an effort to help drive students towards programming and increase general interest in the field. We also planned and led several workshops to teach students about some fundamental programming concepts and basic Procesing functions that we used to create our our game. 

[TAP](https://ggc.edu/academics/school-of-science-and-technology/research-internships-service-learning/technology-ambassador-program) (Technology Ambassadors Program) provides a collaborative environment that encourages IT students to think outside of the box and work together to develop projects and workshops to showcase the creative side of technology.

## Game Description 
How to play: 
The game allows up to two players who can compete against each other. One player could use the arrow keys to maneuver their spaceship. Another player could use the AWD keys. The objective of the game is to shoot the moving targets, which are worth 100 points each. Whichever player reaches 1000 points first will win the match.

## Technology

### Processing
[Processing](https://processing.org/) is an IDE (Intergrated Development Environment) for an open-source programming language built on top of Java with the same name. Processing is an electronic sketchbook used by students, artists, designers, programmers, and other professionals to create computer graphics, digital arts, and visual designs.
