# Introducing Java Programming Concepts through Making a Retro-style Game
## Description
Difficulty Level:

Target Audience: 

Duration of Workshop:

Needed Materials: 

Learning Outcomes: 

This project, done in the Georgia Gwinnet College TAP (Technology Ambassadors program), was created in an effort to help drive students towards programming and increase general interest in the field.
In this project, we created a simple version of Space Invaders using Processing. We then taught a workshop on some basic programming concepts within processing to show what simple buildibg blocks we used to end up with our game. This effectively helped show that programming was not as hard as it seemed.

## Outreach Activities
1. CREATE Symposium, Apr 25, 2023, Georgia Gwinnett College.
2. Atlanta Science Festival - Mar 25, 2023.
3. Tap Expo, Mar 21, 2023, Georgia Gwinnett College – To promote IT field and the TAP program to college students.
4. Class Workshops – on Apr 10 and two on Apr 13, to promote IT field to non-IT college students.

## Technology
This project uses Processing and Tableau. 
### 1. Processing

Processing for the game, Tableau for survey data analysis
[Processing](https://processing.org/) is a Java sketchbook, [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/trial/tableau-software?utm_campaign_id=2017049&utm_language=EN&utm_country=USCA&kw=tableau&adgroup=CTX-Brand-Priority-Core-E&adused=ETA&matchtype=e&placement=&d=7013y000000vYhH&cq_cmp=370186750&cq_net=s&cq_plac=&msclkid=26981524b0631c5b97b6717da3aecb8f&gclsrc=ds&gclsrc=ds) is a Business Intelligence tool

### 2. Tableau 

## Project Setup/Installation
With Processing installed:
1. Dowload the repository as a ZIP
2. Extract is to your desired location
3. Open the code folder
4. Open the .pde file
5. Click the play button in the top left
6. Follow on-screen instructions to play the game
