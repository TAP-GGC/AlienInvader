# Introducing Java Programming Concepts through Making a Retro-style Game
## Description
Difficulty Level:

Target Audience: students of all ages 

Duration of Workshop:

Needed Materials: 

Learning Outcomes: 
1. Having a basic understanding of the fundamental programming concepts in Java such as loops, if else statements, and object-oriented programming that could also be applied to other languages. 
2. Familiarizing students with the rudimentary keywords and functions in Processing and learning to manipulate elementary mathematical functions to create geometric shapes and visual designs. 
3. Encouraging students to pursuit STEM majors.

This TAP project is our take on the classic game Space Invaders. Using Processing, we are able to develop a multiplayer retro style arcade game with the inspiration from the Japanese 1978 fixed shooter video game. It's a fun and simple game created in an effort to help drive students towards programming and increase general interest in the field. The game allows up to two players who can compete against each other. 
We then taught a workshop on some basic programming concepts within processing to show what simple buildibg blocks we used to end up with our game. 

[TAP](https://ggc.edu/academics/school-of-science-and-technology/research-internships-service-learning/technology-ambassador-program) (Technology Ambassadors Program) provides a collaborative environment that encourages IT students to think outside of the box and work together to develop projects and workshops to showcase the creative side of technology.

## Outreach Activities
1. CREATE Symposium, Apr 25, 2023, Georgia Gwinnett College.
2. Atlanta Science Festival - Mar 25, 2023.
3. Tap Expo, Mar 21, 2023, Georgia Gwinnett College – To promote IT field and the TAP program to college students.
4. Class Workshops – on Apr 10 and two on Apr 13, to promote IT field to non-IT college students.

## Technology
This project uses Processing and Tableau. 
### 1. Processing
[Processing](https://processing.org/) is an IDE (Intergrated Development Environment) for an open-source programming language built on top of Java with the same name. Processing is an electronic sketchbook used by students, artists, designers, programmers, and other professionals to create computer graphics, digital arts, and visual designs.

### 2. Tableau 
[Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/trial/tableau-software?utm_campaign_id=2017049&utm_language=EN&utm_country=USCA&kw=tableau&adgroup=CTX-Brand-Priority-Core-E&adused=ETA&matchtype=e&placement=&d=7013y000000vYhH&cq_cmp=370186750&cq_net=s&cq_plac=&msclkid=26981524b0631c5b97b6717da3aecb8f&gclsrc=ds&gclsrc=ds) is a Business Intelligence tool used for survey data analysis. The pre-survey and post-survey are created using Tableau. 

## Project Setup/Installation
### Download Processing
1. Use the following link to install Processing on a computer: https://processing.org/download
