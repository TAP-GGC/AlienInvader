# Introducing Java Programming Concepts through Making a Retro-style Game

This project, done in the Georgia Gwinnet College TAP (Technology Ambassadors program), was created in an effort to help drive students towards programming and increase general interest in the field.

In this project, we created a simple version of Space Invaders using Processing. We then taught a workshop on some basic programming concepts within processing to show what simple buildibg blocks we used to end up with our game. This effectively helped show that programming was not as hard as it seemed.

## Technologies Used
Processing for the game, Tableau for survey data analysis
[Processing](https://processing.org/) is a Java sketchbook, [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/trial/tableau-software?utm_campaign_id=2017049&utm_language=EN&utm_country=USCA&kw=tableau&adgroup=CTX-Brand-Priority-Core-E&adused=ETA&matchtype=e&placement=&d=7013y000000vYhH&cq_cmp=370186750&cq_net=s&cq_plac=&msclkid=26981524b0631c5b97b6717da3aecb8f&gclsrc=ds&gclsrc=ds) is a Business Intelligence tool

## How to Use
With Processing installed:
1. Dowload the repository as a ZIP
2. Extract is to your desired location
3. open the code folder
4. open the .pde file
5. click the play button in the top left
6. follow on-screen instructions to play the game
