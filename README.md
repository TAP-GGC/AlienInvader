# Introducing Java Programming Concepts through Making a Retro-style Game
## Description

Target Audience: 

Duration of Workshop:

Needed Materials: 

Learning Outcomes: 

This project, done in the Georgia Gwinnet College TAP (Technology Ambassadors program), was created in an effort to help drive students towards programming and increase general interest in the field.
In this project, we created a simple version of Space Invaders using Processing. We then taught a workshop on some basic programming concepts within processing to show what simple buildibg blocks we used to end up with our game. This effectively helped show that programming was not as hard as it seemed.

## Technology
This project uses Processing and Tableau. 
### 1. Processing
[Processing](https://processing.org/) is an IDE (Intergrated Development Environment) for an open-source programming language built on top of Java with the same name. Processing is an electronic sketchbook used by students, artists, designers, programmers, and other professionals to create computer graphics, digital arts, and visual designs. 

### 2. Tableau 
[Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/trial/tableau-software?utm_campaign_id=2017049&utm_language=EN&utm_country=USCA&kw=tableau&adgroup=CTX-Brand-Priority-Core-E&adused=ETA&matchtype=e&placement=&d=7013y000000vYhH&cq_cmp=370186750&cq_net=s&cq_plac=&msclkid=26981524b0631c5b97b6717da3aecb8f&gclsrc=ds&gclsrc=ds) is a Business Intelligence tool used for survey data analysis. 

## Project Setup/Installation
### Download Processing
1. Use the following link to install Processing on a computer: https://processing.org/download
2. Go to your download folder and extract the ZIP file
3. Run the processing.exe application 
### With Processing installed:
1. Dowload the repository as a ZIP
2. Extract is to your desired location
